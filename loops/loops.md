# Loops

* Loops are iterative statements
* Block of statements are repeatedly executed as long as condition is true
* Condition given in loop must become false after some finite iterations otherwise its a infinite loop
* Values used in condition must update inside the body of finite loop
* Four types of loops
* pre-tested loop while()
* post-tested loop do..while()
* counter controlled loop for()
* for each loop for Collections for()
